/**
 * Sets a property to the base name of a specified file, optionally minus a
 * suffix.
 *
 * This task can accept the following attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>file
 * <li>property
 * <li>suffix
 * </ul>
 * The <b>file</b> and <b>property</b> attributes are required. The
 * <b>suffix</b> attribute can be specified either with or without
 * the &quot;.&quot;, and the result will be the same (ie., the
 * returned file name will be minus the .suffix).
 * <p>
 * When this task executes, it will set the specified property to the
 * value of the last element in the specified file. If file is a
 * directory, the basename will be the last directory element. If file
 * is a full-path filename, the basename will be the simple file name.
 * If a suffix is specified, and the specified file ends in that suffix,
 * the basename will be the simple file name without the suffix.
