 * <tr><td>Sync to head using P4USER, P4PORT and P4CLIENT settings specified</td><td>&lt;P4Sync <br>P4view="//projects/foo/main/source/..." <br>P4User="fbloggs" <br>P4Port="km01:1666" <br>P4Client="fbloggsclient" /&gt;</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>Sync to head using P4USER, P4PORT and P4CLIENT settings defined in environment</td><td>&lt;P4Sync P4view="//projects/foo/main/source/..." /&gt;</td></tr>
