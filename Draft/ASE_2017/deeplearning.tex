Recently, deep learning algorithms have been widely used to improve research tasks in software engineering. Lam et al.~\cite{lam2015combining} combined deep neural network (DNN)~\cite{hecht1988theory} with rVSM~\cite{zhou2012should}, a revised vector space model, to improve the performance of bug localization. Raychev et al.~\cite{raychev2014code} reduced a code completion problem to a natural-language processing problem of predicting sentences' probabilities. They used recurrent neural network~\cite{mikolov2010recurrent} to predict the probabilities of subsequent words in a sentence. Mou et al.~\cite{mou2014tbcnn} proposed a tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing. Results of their experiment showed the effectiveness of TBCNN in two different software engineering tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and detecting code snippets of certain patterns. Pascanu et al.~\cite{pascanu2015malware} employed recurrent neural network to build a malware classification model in software system. Yuan et al.~\cite{yuan2014droid} adopted deep belief network (DBN)~\cite{hinton2009deep} to predict mobile malware in Android platform. Their experimental results showed that a deep learning technique is suitable for predicting malware in software system. In our work, we propose a deep discriminative autoencoder model for defect prediction.


%Our work diers from the above study mainly in three
%aspects. First, we use DBN to learn semantic features directly
%from source code, while features generated from their
%approach are relations among existing features. Since the existing
%features used cannot distinguish many semantic code
%dierences, the combination of these features would still fail
%to distinguish the semantic dierences. For example, if two
%changes add the same line at dierent locations in the same
%le, the traditional features used cannot distinguish the two
%changes. Thus, the generated new features, which are combinations
%of the traditional features, would also fail to distinguish
%the two changes. Second, we evaluate the eectiveness
%of our generated features using dierent classiers and
%for both within-project and cross-project defect prediction,
%while they use LR only for within-project defect prediction.
%Third, we focus on le level defect prediction, while they
%work on change level defect prediction.

%Yang et
%al. [68] proposed an approach that leveraged deep learning
%to generate features from existing features and then used
%these new features to predict whether a commit is buggy or
%not. This work was motivated by the weaknesses of logistic
%regression (LR) that LR can not combine features to generate
%new features. They used DBN to generate features from
%14 traditional change level features: the number of modi
%ed subsystems, modied directories, modied les, code
%added, code deleted, line of code before/after the change,
%les before/after the change, and several developer experience
%related features [68]. 

%Other studies leverage deep learning to address other
%problems in software engineering. Lam et al. [26] combined
%deep learning algorithms and information retrieval tech-niques to improve fault localization. Raychev et al. [53]
%reduced the code completion problem to a natural language
%processing problem and used deep learning to predict the
%probabilities of next tokens. White et al. [65] leveraged deep
%learning to model program languages for code suggestion.
%Similarly, Mou et al. [39] used deep learning to model
%programs and showed that deep learning can capture
%programs' structural information. In addition, deep learn-ing has also been used for malware classication [50, 69],
%acoustic recognition [24,36,37], etc.
